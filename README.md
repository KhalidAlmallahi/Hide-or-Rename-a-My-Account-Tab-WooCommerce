# Hide or Rename a My Account Tab – WooCommerce

Many WooCommerce websites don’t need the “Downloads” tab in the My Account page. Or maybe the “Addresses” tab needs to be renamed into something more user-friendly 🙂

Well, here are 2 super simple snippets to hide or rename any tabs you have in the My Account page, including custom tabs that are added by plugins such as Account Funds, Subscriptions, and so on.

Simply note down the URL of the tab e.g. “edit-account” (see image) and edit the snippets accordingly. Enjoy!
